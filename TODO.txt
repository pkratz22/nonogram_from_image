1. Draw in new grid lines based on number of rows and columns so there won't be noise
2. Use new grid lines to find each cell (which will be contour) (get them by the coordinates of their corners)
3. Using the coordinates, retrieve location for each cell in original image
4. Cycle through each cell and search for numbers inside
